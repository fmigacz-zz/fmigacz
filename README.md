### ¡Hola y Bienvenidos! Hei og velkommen!

👷‍♂️ I am an App Innovation Specialist at Microsoft - guiding customers into speeding up the deployment of features and the deployment frequency.

🤠 I'm also currently working on a small team of experts who update the [Azure Architecture Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/browse/).

🤖 I collaborate with others on hackathons, and to create demos for work.
